# Football Manager Data Analysis
Using a Kaggle dataset with player data from the popular video game “Football Manager,” I used a supervised machine learning approach to analyze the data using PySpark and predict every player’s market value. 
I then looked at this data to find the players with the largest discrepancies between their expected value and their current value to help target undervalued assets for football clubs to purchase.
This was a project completed for my Data Mining course taken at UTK for my masters in CS
